## INTRODUCTION

There are two alternative procedures for building VocBench3: with Maven and with Npm.
We suggest to follow the one with Maven since it does not require npm to be installed (it is downloaded as a plugin dependency and run by Maven during the building process) and requires less interaction steps.

##	BUILDING WITH MAVEN

### Prerequisites

Maven installed.

### Building

Execute the command
```
mvn clean install
```
from the root of the project (/pmki-portal, where the pom.xml file is located). This command will generate three folders: 

*	`/node_modules`: contains the dependencies of the application;
*	`/dist`: contains the static assets of the front-end;
*	`/target`: contains the generated pmki-portal-<versionnumber>.war web archive.

The directory `/dist` is the distribution that contains the static assets of the front-end generated by the npm build procedure. 
This distribution can be deployed on any http server. Alternatively, the war file can be deployed on any application server.


##	BUILDING WITH NG-CLI

### Prerequisites

Required [Node 10.9](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or later.
This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.0 that requires Node 10.9 or later installed. The Angular CLI requires Node 8, but development requires Node 10.

### Installing the dependencies

Execute the command below:
```
npm install  # or just: npm i
```

### Building

After having installed the dependencies, run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.


### Different Deployments

In order to run the PMKI portal in development mode, it is possible also to run `ng serve`.
This command will serve the portal on a development server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
